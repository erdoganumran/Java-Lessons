Overriding Superclass Methods
• Sometimes a subclass inherits a method from its superclass, but the
method is inadequate for the subclass’s purpose. Because the subclass
is more specialized than the superclass, it is sometimes necessary for
the subclass to replace inadequate superclass methods with more
suitable ones. This is know overriding.
Method Overriding Rules
1. There must be is-a relationship(inheritance)
2. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
3. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class
4. Access modifier: Needs to be same or more visible
• public - > public
• protected - > protected, public
• default - > default, protected, public
5. Return type:
• must be same or
• covariant type (same class type or sub class type)
 
@override -->  this is a notation means we don’t want use the method on the class, we want use the method we overrided.
