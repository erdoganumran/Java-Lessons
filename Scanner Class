// if you use nextline method it won't be described in the scanner. this is the only disadvantage of nexLine. in all other methods enter key left in the scanner. however nextline doesn't ignore enter key.
//if you use nexline method after another method, nextline method will be going to read the previous enter key as a default, that is why we need to clear out of scanner memory with input.nextLine();
input.nextLine();
