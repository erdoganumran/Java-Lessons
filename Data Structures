Data Structure in java is defined as the collection of data pieces that offers an effective means of storing and organising data in a computer. Linked List, Stack, Queue, and arrays are a few examples of java data structures.
• Array, Map, Collection
• Array is the only data structure support primitives and non primitives
• if we need to use in other 2 data structure we need to use wrapper class, we need covert primitive data type to object and we can use this data in our other data structure

There are two types of Data Structures:

Primitive Data Structures: byte, short,  int, float, char, boolean, long, and double are primitive Data types.
Non-primitive Data Structures: Linear Data Structures
                                                      Non-linear Data Structures
