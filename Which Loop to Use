• You can use a for loop, a while loop or a do-while loop, whichever is convenient.
• A for-loop maybe used if the number of repetition is known in advance
• A while loop may be used used if the number of repetition is not fixed
• A do-while loop maybe used to replace while loop if the loop body must be
executed before the condition is checked.
