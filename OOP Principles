There are 4 Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:
• Encapsulation
• Inheritance
• Abstraction: for reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary deatils
• Polymorphism
OOP: A design pattern of the applications in an organized and modular way

Coupling: Any changes in a class can affect many classes which are couplinh. We should reduce coupling to increase independency for not impacting so much.

Object Class
• The Java API has a class named Object, which all other classes directly
or indirectly inherit from.Methods of object class;
equals
finalize
wait
getClass
toString
Creating an object from object class;
