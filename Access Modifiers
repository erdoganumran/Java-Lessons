Access Modifiers: define the accessibility
• Variables, Constructors and methods can have all four access modifiers
• There are 4 access modifiers available in Java:
• public: ALWAYS rechable
• protected: 
• The protected access modifier is specified using the keyword protected.
• The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible
within same package or sub classes in different package.
like public in a package.
• default: 
When no access modifier is specified for a class, method or data
member – it is said to be having the default access modifier by default.
The data members, class or methods which are not declared using any
access modifiers are accessible only within the same package.ONLY reachable within the same package. public in package, private outside the package.
• private: 
• The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private.
• The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only
within the class in which they are declared.
• Any other class of same package will not be able to access these
members.
• Top level classes can not be declared as private.
ONLY reachable within the same class
• A top level java class can have two access modifiers: public and default
• Variables, Constructors and methods can have all four access modifiers
• Private members can nit be inherited by child classes

Final Keyword
• final is a non-access modifier which is applicable to a variable, method,
and class.
Final variables-->to create constant variables
When instance variable is final, we need to initialize it in:
• same statement
• constructor
• init block
final arrays
• If array is declared as final, elements of array can be changed without
any problem
• Arrays are objects and object variables are always references in Java.
When we declare an object variable as final, it means that the variable
can not be changed to refer to anything else.
final arrayList
• Follows same rules of arrays
• We can remove or update any values
• We can not re-assign it to another object using new keyword
final methods--> 
• When a method is declared with final keyword, it is called final method.
• A final method can not be overridden.
• prevent from overriding  like String class. it is immutable.
final classes--> 
• When a class is declared with final keyword, it is called a final class. A
final class cannot be extended(inherited).
• You can not make a class immutable without making it final.(String
class)
• it is also for preventclass from inheritence.
