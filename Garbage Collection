Garbage Collection: Collection of unreferenced objects
Garbage Collector: responsible for collecting the unreferenced objects from java heap. and destroys it ( finalize())
• JVM periodically runs a process known as the garbage collector, which
removes unreferenced objects from memory
• It is automatically done by the garbage collector (a part of JVM)
How can an object be unreferenced?
• By nulling the reference
• By assigning a reference to another

Unreferenced objects:
1. null keyword:
  String str = ""Java"";
  str = null;

Dog dog1=new Dog();//dog1 is reference name
        dog1.name=""Lucy"";
        dog1= new Dog();-->I don't have any reference name here it is eligible for garbage collection.

2. creating a new object
  String str = ""Java"";
  str = ""Python"";
  
        ArrayList<Integer>list1=new ArrayList<>();
        list1.add(100);
        ArrayList<Integer>list2=list1;//they are pointing the same object, so they will have same elements.
        list2.add(200);
        list2.add(300);

        System.out.println(list1);
        System.out.println(list2);
        System.out.println(list1==list2);
