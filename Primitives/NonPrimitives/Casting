PRIMITIVES
•	double > float > long > int > short > byte
•	float and doubles are for decimal numbers.
•	Boolean
boolean: true/false

Primitive Type Casting
•	Smaller Primitives can be directly assigned to larger primitive type, larger primitives can NOT be directly assigned to smaller primitives.
float :100000000.05F
double :5.5

According to Java primitive data types tutorial , all primitive data types have a default value. 
So the initialization it's implicit. A good practice: initialize values before using to prevent unexpected behavior.

NON-PRIMITIVES
•	String
String name = “ …”;
or
String name;
name = “…”

•	Array, Classes, Collections, Map Etc.

CASTING

Implicit Casting
• Casting smaller primitive types to larger primitive types
• Implicitly done by the compiler
•	Byte a = 25;  or short x = 1000;
•	Int b = a;       or   long y = (long) x;

Explicit Casting
Casting larger primitive types to smaller primitive types
• Must be done explicitly
"•	Int a =100;             or long x = 2000;
•	Byte b = (byte)a;         short y = (short)x"
